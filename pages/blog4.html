            <h2>What Is TDS and Why Is It Important?</h2> <br>
            <p>TDS stands for Tax Deducted at Source. As the name suggests, this tax is deducted by the income payer
              (deductor) while making a payment to the deductee. Such taxes are taken from the total amount payable by
              the payer and deposited with the Income Tax Department. The person paying the income and deducting the TDS
              is called the deductor, while the person receiving the income and on whose behalf the tax has been
              deducted is called the deductee. <br>
              For example, while making interest payments, banks may deduct TDS @ 10% if the interest amount exceeds Rs.
              40,000. (Source: Income Tax Department) Assuming the interest amount payable is Rs. 50,000, the bank may
              deduct Rs. 5,000 (10% of Rs. 50,000) and pay the remaining amount of Rs. 45,000 to the deposit holder.
              <br>
              In this case, the bank is the deductor, and the deposit holder is the deductee. The bank deposits Rs.
              5,000 with Income Tax Department against the deposit holder’s PAN (Permanent Account Number). The taxpayer
              can claim credit for such TDS while filing their Income Tax Return (ITR) and set off it against the total
              tax liability.

            <h2>Why is TDS Important?</h2> <br>
            <p>TDS mechanism is established by the Government to collect tax at source. It
              helps prevent tax evasion to an extent, as the deductors file all the TDS deduction details in quarterly
              TDS returns. This enables the Government to know the income details of the taxpayers. Accordingly, it
              becomes obligatory for the taxpayer to disclose such income and pay tax on such income in their Income
              Tax Return.
              Suppose the taxpayer has not disclosed such income in the ITR. In that case, the computerized return
              processing automatically detects the mismatch and highlights the same to the Income Tax officers for
              suitable action to recover the taxes.
              Additionally, such TDS also becomes an interim revenue source for the Government wherein partial taxes
              are recovered during the year in which income has been earned.

            <h2>TDS Rates for Most Common TDS Deductions</h2> <br>
            <p>TDS from salaries are the most common TDS deductions, wherein the employer company is liable to deduct
              tax at the average tax rate applicable to the employee. The total tax payable on salaries is then deducted
              monthly from the compensation being paid by the employer. <br>
              However, in the case of other TDS deductions, the Government has specified fixed TDS rates when the
              payments exceed the specified threshold. The specified TDS rates for most common TDS deductions in the
              case of individual deductors are as below: <br> <br>

            The tax rates above are for payments to resident Indians. In the case of non-resident taxpayers, the tax
            rates may be different. Further, it should not be construed that once any TDS has been deducted from any
            income, there is no further tax liability on the taxpayer for such income. For example, suppose the marginal
            tax rate to the taxpayer is 30% (plus applicable cess and surcharge), and TDS has been deducted at 10%. In
            that case, the taxpayer is further liable to pay an additional tax of 20% (plus cess and surcharge).
