            <h1>What is GST ?</h1>
            <p>GST is known as the Goods and Services Tax. It is an indirect tax which has replaced many indirect taxes
              in India such as the excise duty, VAT, services tax, etc. The Goods and Service Tax Act was passed in the
              Parliament on 29th March 2017 and came into effect on 1st July 2017.
              <br>
              In other words, Goods and Service Tax (GST) is levied on the supply of goods and services. Goods and
              Services Tax Law in India is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that is levied on every
              value addition. GST is a single domestic indirect tax law for the entire country.

            <h2>What is GST Registration</h2> <br>
            <p>Under Goods And Services Tax (GST), businesses whose turnover exceeds the threshold limit of Rs.40 lakh
              or Rs.20 lakh or Rs.10 lakh as the case may be, must register as a normal taxable person. It is called GST
              registration.
              For certain businesses, registration under GST is mandatory. If the organization carries on business
              without registering under GST, it is an offence under GST and heavy penalties will apply.
              GST registration usually takes between 2-6 working days. Team Clear can help you obtain GST registration
              faster in 3 easy steps.

            <h2>Who should file GST Returns?</h2> <br>
            <p>Under the GST regime, regular businesses having more than Rs.5 crore as annual aggregate turnover (and
              taxpayers who have not opted for the QRMP scheme) have to file two monthly returns and one annual return.
              This amounts to 25 returns each year.
              <br>
              Taxpayers with a turnover of up to Rs.5 crore have the option to file returns under the QRMP scheme. The
              number of GSTR filings for QRMP filers is 9 each year, which include 4 GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B returns each and
              an annual return. Note that QRMP filers have to pay tax on a monthly basis even though they are filing
              returns quarterly.
              <br>
              There are also separate statements/returns required to be filed in special cases such as composition
              dealers where the number of GSTR filings is 5 each year (4 statement-cum-challans in CMP-08 and 1 annual
              return GSTR-4).

            <h2>GST Procedure</h2> <br>
            <p>Goods and Service Tax (GST) is structured for efficient tax collection, reduction in corruption, easy
              inter-state movement of goods and a lot more.
              <br>
              The GST Law provides for self-assessment to facilitate easy compliance and payment of taxes. It also
              explains the notices, the demand and recovery provisions when the taxes are unpaid, short paid and/or
              returns are not filed.

            <h2>What is the Eligibility Criteria for GST Registration?</h2> <br>
            <p>The following mentions the categories and eligibility for GST registration:</p> <br>
            <strong>Aggregate Turnover</strong>
            <p class="afterStrong">Any service provider who provides a service value of more than Rs. 20 Lakhs aggregate
              in a year is
              required to obtain GST registration. In the special category states, this limit is Rs. 10 lakhs. Any
              entity engaged in the exclusive supply of goods whose aggregate turnover crosses Rs.40 lakhs is required
              to obtain GST registration.</p> <br>
            <strong>Inter-state Business</strong>
            <p class="afterStrong">An entity shall register for GST if they supply goods inter state, i.e., from one
              state to another
              irrespective of their aggregate turnover. Inter state service providers need to obtain GST registration
              only if their annual turnover exceeds Rs. 20 lakhs. (In special category states, this limit is Rs. 10
              lakhs).</p> <br>
            <strong>E-commerce Platform</strong>
            <p class="afterStrong">Any individual supplying goods or services through an e-commerce platform shall apply
              for GST
              registration. The individual shall register irrespective of the turnover. Hence, sellers on Flipkart,
              Amazon and other e-commerce platforms must obtain registration to commence activity.</p> <br>
            <strong>Casual Taxable Persons</strong>
            <p class="afterStrong">Any individual undertaking supply of goods, services seasonally or intermittently
              through a temporary
              stall or shop must apply for GST. The individual shall apply irrespective of the annual aggregate
              turnover.</p> <br>
            <strong>Voluntary Registration</strong>
            <p class="afterStrong">Any entity can obtain GST registration voluntarily. Earlier, any entity who obtained
              GST voluntarily
              could not surrender the registration for up to a year. However, after revisions, voluntary GST
              registration can be surrendered by the applicant at any time.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="content">
            <h2>Types of GST Registration</h2> <br>
            <p>The following details the types of GST registration:</p><br>

            <strong>Casual Taxable Person</strong>
            <p class="afterStrong">Any taxpayer establishing a stall or seasonal shop shall register under Casual

              register as a casual taxable person, the taxpayer shall pay a deposit equal to the amount of GST
              liability. The liability should match the active registration periods. The registration remains active for
              a period of 3 months.</p> <br>
            <strong>Non-Resident Taxable Person</strong>
